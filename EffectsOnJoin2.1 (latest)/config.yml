# === EffectsOnJoin Configuration ===
# This config controls what potion effects are applied to players when they join or respawn.
# You can define effects globally, or per specific world.
# Supports conditions like first-join only, time-based triggers (day/night), and gamemode-specific effects.

# === üîß Notes ===
# ‚û§ Valid values for only_at_time: ANY, DAY, NIGHT
# ‚û§ first_join_only: true means the effect is only applied once per player (on their first join ever)
# ‚û§ gamemode: can be 'all' or a comma-separated list of Bukkit gamemode names: SURVIVAL, CREATIVE, ADVENTURE, SPECTATOR
# ‚û§ You can add as many effects per world as you like
# ‚û§ To disable an effect, set enabled: false (it will also remove the effect from players if active)
